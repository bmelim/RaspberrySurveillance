Surveillance system designed for Raspberry PI.

It is a web interface that can:

  * Save captured videos to Webdav

## Camera ##
This is the hardware used to build the camera:
* Raspberry Pi Model B 512MB RAM
* Camera Module for Raspberry Pi
* WiFi USB Nano
* OpenBox Sky Case
* 16GB SD

Cost (approximately): 900 SEK / $135 / 100 Â£

## Install ##
These instructions are a work in progress!

I have developed this on ArchLinux. I'll be writing instructions as if you are using ArchLinux and you'll have to translate it to your distribution.

### Required packages ###

    sudo pacman -S extra/php-apc
    sudo pacman -S core/curl

### PHP.ini ###
There are some extensions needed.

    extension="apc.so"
    extension="sysvsem.so"
